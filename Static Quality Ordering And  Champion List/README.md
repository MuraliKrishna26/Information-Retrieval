Desccription of Authoritative Score Data : 


     - The file containing the number of favourable reviews for each of the documents in the corpus.
     - The first column of this file denotes the doc no. and the second column denotes the corresponding number of favourable reviews.


The following concepts are implemented in the python program :


     - You need to implement static quality ordering on the above corpus. You have to extract a static quality score for each document            from the number of favourable reviews as provided above. Maintain a global champion list for each term sorted by a common ordering        (i.e. static quality score). This champion list for a term ‘t’ is made up of two posting lists consisting of a disjointed set of          documents. The first list is the high list containing documents with highest tf values for ‘t’ and the second list is the low list        containing other documents having term ‘t’. You need to define a suitable heuristic to select the minimal efficient value of ‘r’          where ‘r’ is the number of documents to be contained in the high list.

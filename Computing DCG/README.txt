Computing_DCG Python file answers the following questions : 

a) Make a file having URLs in order of max DCG. State how many such files could be made.
b) Compute nDCG
       i. At 50
      ii. For the whole dataset
   For the above two questions, results have to be produced for qid:4 only and consider the
   relevance judgement labels as the relevance score.
c) Assume a model that simply ranks URLs on the basis of the value of feature 75 (sum of
   TF-IDF on the whole document) i.e. the higher the value, the more relevant the URL.
   Assume any non zero relevance judgment value to be relevant. Plot a Precision-Recall
   curve for query “qid:4”.
